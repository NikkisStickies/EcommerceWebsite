# Introduction

## Business purpose
The purpose of this business is to provide a new outlet for people to express themselves with stickers. From customizing the back of a laptop to advertising a business, Nikki’s Stickies Stickers is a business for all people interested. The business should be able to sell goods over the internet through an ecommerce website. The user should be able to track their orders and easily navigate our site. 

## Business scope
The organization is named Nikki’s Stickies because it’s a fun and catchy name that represents the product and the owner in one name. The business scope is to help people who want to express themselves through customizable art, help with journal therapy, and possibly to help businesses get their names out. The website will allow people to grab a photo or custom design their own and the website will turn it into one or many stickers.  The business will have a database for customers and will be able to track their past and current orders. The business will hold the user’s personal information so that the user does not have to put down the shipping/billing every time. 

## Overview
The website will be split into many divisions that will allow people to create stickers for certain reasons, such as, personal (therapy, design, and creativity) and business (promotion, eye popping, and informative). The external entities are related to the internal divisions because the people and businesses can all buy, sell, and use the product.

## Definitions 
Stickers: Photos that can be applied on surfaces that can be used for business and design purposes.

-       If too many stickers are asked to be made, the customer will be provided instructions on how to get the number of stickers they want, for example, placing two orders, instead of one.
-       If a sticker is offensive, we can offer ideas on how to work around it, such as taking off the offensive part, blurring it, or changing it to something acceptable.

## Business structure
-       The business will be run at home with a printer that is made for making quality stickers. The stickers materials will be American Quality products. The process may include more people, but the business is mainly run and operated by Nicole Leser.
