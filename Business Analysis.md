# Introduction

## Business purpose
The purpose of this business is to provide a new outlet for people to express themselves with stickers. From customizing the back of a laptop to advertising a business, Nikki’s Stickies Stickers is a business for all people interested. The business should be able to sell goods over the internet through an e-commerce website. The user should be able to track their orders and easily navigate our site. 

## Business scope
The organization is named Nikki’s Stickies because it’s a fun and catchy name that represents the product and the owner in one name. The business scope is to help people who want to express themselves through customizable art, help with journal therapy, and possibly help businesses get their names out. The website will allow people to grab a photo or custom design their own and the website will turn it into one or many stickers.  The business will have a database for customers and will be able to track their past and current orders. The business will hold the user’s personal information so that the user does not have to put down the shipping/billing every time. 

## Overview
The website will be split into many divisions that will allow people to create stickers for certain reasons, such as, personal (therapy, design, and creativity) and business (promotion, eye-popping, and informative). The external entities are related to the internal divisions because the people and businesses can all buy, sell, and use the product.

## Definitions 
E-commerce website: Electronic commerce is online business transactions and interactions that sell information, services, and goods through telecommunication networks.
Stickers: Photos that can be applied on surfaces that can be used for business and design purposes.

# Business management requirements
## Business environment
The sticker business is small and personally run by Nicole Leser. The business although small can capture many sectors such as journal therapy. The sticker business is highly competitive but not impossible to breach. 

## Mission, goals, and objectives
The mission is to give people more life to their journals, therapy, business, and expressing themselves. The goal is to create a functioning website and business that people can easily use to create stickers fast and cheaply. 

## Business model
The business model is based on e-commerce and direct-to-consumer (DTC). The process of the business is stated below: 
1. Go to the website
2. Determine if it’s for personal use or business
3. Design Sticker
4. Put information in
5. Create and ship stickers

## Information environment
We are planning to create a business that caters to the needs of everyone when it comes to stationary. That is why the portfolio is so diverse and we have stationary, journal therapy, and customizable stickers. The long term goal is for our customer acquisition to be as close to zero as possible. We can do this by gaining a bigger following on social media so marketing costs can go down. The database will be made with Python and SQL to properly store our items and the user's data. 

# Business operational requirements

## Business processes
Website:
-   Needs accessibility
-   Need to be functional where a user can browse the products, add them to a shopping cart and purchase them.

## Business operational policies and rules
![2023-03-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117126258/222517815-69fff224-f08b-4959-81f0-cdc87ed884bb.png)
**Table 1**
## Business operational constraints
-   Time able to work on stickers
-   Size of the stickers
-   Workers creating the stickers
-   The number of stickers asked to be made

## Business operational modes
-   If unable to complete an order due to an influx of orders, an email will be sent explaining the circumstance and the customer will be given a timeline for when the sticker can be made.
-   If too many stickers are asked to be made, the customer will be provided instructions on how to get the number of stickers they want, for example, placing two orders, instead of one.
-   If a sticker is offensive, we can offer ideas on how to work around it, such as taking off the offensive part, blurring it, or changing it to something acceptable.

## Business operational quality
-   The stickers are only made with quality materials and the output of the image should match expectations.
-   The data structure that holds the orders will be in a queue and the customers that ordered first will be worked on first. First come first serve.
-   Stickers drafts will first be sent to the customer, before mass producing or shipping, either via email or text.
## Business structure
The business will be run at home with a printer that is made for making quality stickers. The sticker materials will be American Quality products. The process may include more people, but the business is mainly run and operated by Nicole Leser who is the CEO. The product manager is Tara Trom. There is another stakeholder who is contracted named Jack Leser. 

# Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

## Preliminary operational concept
To ensure the efficiency of the e-commerce website, we must comply with the relevant regulations. The user should be able to have multiple ways of paying for their items, be provided a reliable shipping process, and be provided a shopping cart to add the stickers to while they browse our products. 

### Operational policies and constraints;
- Payment Policy: Explains the payment options that will be provided to our customers assuming they meet certain expectations outlined. This will include credit cards and PayPal as accepted forms of payment. 
- Shipping Policy: Explains the shipping options that will be given to the customer such as standard and international shipping. 
- Privacy Policy: Explains how customer data, such as payment and shipping information, is processed and used by the website. 
- Legal Constraints: Legal guidelines such as data protection laws and consumer protection.  

### Description of the proposed system;
The e-commerce website will be able to offer users a shopping cart to hold their items while they browse products. The website will give users multiple payment and shipping options when executing their order, and do so in a way that protects the user's data. 

### Modes of system operation;
The modes include inventory management, order processing, and maintaining the website in order to ensure that the website is functioning efficiently. 

### User classes and other involved personnel;
- Customers
- Inventory Manager 
- Website Administrator
- Payment Processing Service Team

### Support environment.
The support environment will be the component to ensure the website functions properly. It will include payment and shipping processing systems, a data management system, and software infrastructure. Regular maintenance will be performed on the website. 

## Preliminary operational scenarios
1. Website Inventory: The website should be updated with new sticker products and get a hold of more products to fit the demand. 
2. Shipping/Delivery: If a user wants some stickers to be sent to their house, we should be able to provide the tracking information to customers. 

# Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## Preliminary acquisition concept
The system solution will be acquired by first obtaining the right technical infrastructure such as a database to hold shipping and customer information for the website. There will be a website administrator to make sure the website is maintained. 

## Preliminary deployment concept
The system solution will be validated by the success of users testing the system and exploring all potential ordering options on the website from a customer's perspective and by the corresponding employee interactions to fulfill orders and update customer information. The system solution will be delivered by the technical infrastructure and employees that support the website. And the system solution will be introduced into operations by website deployment and continued maintenance by employees. 

## Preliminary support concept
The desired support infrastructure and manpower considerations will be staff to maintain website functionality and company databases and employees to fulfill order requests. The operating support will fall to the website administrator and manager. The engineering support will fall to the website and database system and their administrator to deal with organizational challenges as orders are received. The maintenance support will also fall to the website and database administrator. The supply support will be provided by employees in charge of sticker creation and material acquisition. And the training support will be given by senior employees to potential future employees.

## Preliminary retirement concept
The system will be removed from operation and retired by removing the website from the web, deleting the database of shipping and customer information, closing sticker manufacturing operations, disposing of any leftover sticker production materials at appropriate waste facilities, and firing employees.

# Project Constraints
The constraints of performing the project within cost and schedule are acquiring sticker materials at the market or reduced market costs, producing and shipping stickers below a certain threshold of cost of the product to ensure profit gain, producing and maintaining orders within given timeframes, maintaining company employees' salaries within company budget, and maintaining an emergency budget to ensure any errors, such as delayed delivery or downed website, are covered in the budget.
